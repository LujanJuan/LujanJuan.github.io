Human:
"Brave of you sir, to so
openly cast an envious eye
towards me and mine.
I suggest you look elsewhere,
lest I consider removing your sight in a more
permanent fashion."

City Elf:
"Take another step,
human, and I guarantee it shall be your last.
My friends are dead and my life is in tatters
because of you and your kin. I have
nothing to lose, but you still possess
your other eye."

Dalish Elf
"What a wonder it is to see such
stalwart bravado in one such as
yourself. It is heartwarming,
truly, to see that there are yet
humans willing to risk a slow
and torturous death in pursuit of
our most sacred treasures."

Mage:
"Tread carefully, friend.
If you intend to cross the
path of one whose soul is
so tightly woven into the realm of the arcane,
I would not suggest
you do it lightly."

Dwarf Commoner:
" I suggest you reach for your purse
swiftly friend. Ale may have dulled
my senses enough so that I merely
maim your pretty features,
but should I become sober I will be
in a mood to show
you a new realm of pain and violence."

Dwarf Noble:
"What I have seen and done to
achieve my position defies belief.
What I am capable of and will
be party to in order to retain it
would chill your soul."
